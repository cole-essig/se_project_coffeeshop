# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

- In the future I would add a scrolling or rotating video block that customers could scroll threw and find weekly updated videos.
- An updated reservation page that shows availabilty for more advanced planning and booking.
- Make the nav links a smoother transition to their respective places.
- Create a BOLD call to action buttton in the hero section that makes it more apparent what the site can do for you.
- Create recipes in a scrolling format so more can be added and implemented (potentially a dropdown menu per recipe).
- Create a section with imbedded links to the Instagram and Facebook pages to create a more natural pull and transition offsite.
